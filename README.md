Synthesis
============

As the original architect behind Synthesis during my tenure with the company, I'm immensely proud of its journey from concept to industry-leading solution. While my role in its ongoing development has transitioned, my commitment to transparency and knowledge sharing remains unwavering. Thus, I've decided to archive the original version of Synthesis on my GitHub repository, acknowledging its foundational significance. This decision reflects not only my dedication to open collaboration but also the evolution and progress that Synthesis has undergone since my departure from the company. As Synthesis continues to thrive under the stewardship of my former colleagues, I look forward to seeing how it continues to shape the landscape of IT monitoring technology.
